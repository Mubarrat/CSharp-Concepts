## Mutable Data Class Concept

This document explores the concept of mutable data classes in C#, a way to define classes with properties that can be changed after object creation.

### Conceptual Design (Using `data` keyword - Not valid currently)

The conceptual code demonstrates the idea of using the `data` keyword (not available in current C#) to create a data class with automatic property generation:

```csharp
// Not valid C# syntax (conceptual)
public data class FileProcessor(string FilePath) : public()
{
    ValidateFilePath(FilePath); // Call to validate

    private void ValidateFilePath(string path)
    {
        if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(path) || !File.Exists(path))
            throw new ArgumentException("Invalid file path provided.");
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**

- The `data` keyword (conceptual) would mark the class as a data class.
- All parameters with uppercase names would become automatically generated public properties with `get; set;` accessors (read and write).
- The `ValidateFilePath` method is shown conceptually, but its placement might differ in a real implementation.

**Current C# Implementation:**

In current C#, you can achieve similar behavior using a regular class with manual property definition:

```csharp
public class FileProcessor
{
    public FileProcessor(string filePath)
    {
        FilePath = filePath;
        ValidateFilePath(filePath);
    }

    public string FilePath { get; set; }

    private void ValidateFilePath(string path)
    {
        if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(path) || !File.Exists(path))
            throw new ArgumentException("Invalid file path provided.");
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**

- The class definition remains as a regular `class`.
- The constructor takes a `filePath` parameter.
- Inside the constructor:
    - The `FilePath` property is explicitly defined with `get; set;` accessors.
    - The `ValidateFilePath` method is called to perform validation.

### Key Characteristics of Mutable Data Classes:

- **Mutable Properties:** Properties with `get; set;` accessors allow modification after object creation.
- **Data-Oriented:** Primarily used to store and manage data.
- **No Custom Logic (Conceptual):** In the conceptual design, the `data` keyword might imply minimal boilerplate code for property creation.

### Current C# Implementation Considerations:

- While automatic property generation isn't available with the current approach, it offers more control over property behavior if needed.
- Explicit property definition can improve code readability, especially for complex properties.

### Summary:

Mutable data classes are a useful approach for creating objects that hold and manipulate data. While the conceptual design using `data` offers concise syntax, the current C# implementation provides a practical alternative with more control over property definitions.
