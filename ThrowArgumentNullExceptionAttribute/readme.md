## Null Check Attribute Exploration (Not Directly Implementable)

This folder explores the concept of a custom `ThrowArgumentNullExceptionAttribute` for improved argument validation in C#. While C# doesn't directly support such attributes for throwing exceptions during construction or property setting, this exploration demonstrates the idea and showcases alternative approaches.

### concept.cs (Conceptual Code)

The `concept.cs` file contains code that demonstrates how a custom `ThrowArgumentNullExceptionAttribute` might work if it were directly supported by the C# compiler. 

Here's a breakdown of the code (not directly implementable):

```csharp
// Not directly supported by C#, but demonstrates the idea.
```

https://github.com/Mubarrat/CSharp-Concepts/blob/866f798a65d290c7f619e6b75d3d4d9180346426/ThrowArgumentNullExceptionAttribute/concept.cs#L1-L22

**Explanation:**

- A custom attribute `ThrowArgumentNullExceptionAttribute` is defined.
- This attribute is applied to properties and methods in `NullCheckAttributeExample`.
- The idea is that the compiler would analyze these attributes and potentially generate warnings or errors at compile time if the arguments are null.

**Important Note:** This code is for demonstration purposes only. C# doesn't currently support custom attributes for this functionality.

### transformed.cs (Alternative Approach)

The `transformed.cs` file showcases an alternative approach achievable with the latest C# version:

**Explanation:**

- The code leverages the existing `ArgumentNullException.ThrowIfNull` method (available in C# 6+) to achieve similar null checking behavior.
- This method throws an `ArgumentNullException` if the provided argument is null.

This approach provides null check functionality without a custom attribute, demonstrating how to achieve the desired outcome with existing C# features.

###  Key Takeaways

- While a custom `ThrowArgumentNullExceptionAttribute` isn't directly implementable, understanding the concept can be helpful for designing  argument validation strategies.
- C# offers alternative approaches like `ArgumentNullException.ThrowIfNull` for effective null checks.
- Exploring these concepts can lead to better code maintainability and reduced runtime errors.

**Further Exploration:**

- Consider exploring code contracts (optional) for expressing preconditions like non-null arguments (libraries like Code Contracts can be used).
- Discuss the concept of defensive programming, where you copy argument values to avoid potential null reference exceptions later in the code.

This exploration highlights the limitations and potential workarounds for achieving null checks in C#. It encourages developers to consider alternative approaches for robust argument validation in their code.
